Hello nodejs

# what is node.js:

* node is a java script runtime built on chrome's V8 java script engine.  

V8 js engine : take in js code and compile it down to machine code. written C++ language. chrome browser is also based on V8 . V8 is written in C++.

node is not a programming language , is is a runtime environment which provides tools and libraries(for setting up webserver and integrating with file system) for the  execution of javascript code.

* node uses an  event-driven,non-blocking I/O model, that makes it lightweight and efficient .

non-blocking I/O : I/O stands for input/output your node application will use I/O anytime it wants to communicate with the outside world(for ex: 1. reading some file from file system 2.communicate with other server 3.querying with database)

enent-driven : process of registering the callbacks and having them called when the I/O is operation is complete.

#importing npm modules
Node.js' package system npm, is the largest ecosystem of opensource libraries in the world.
